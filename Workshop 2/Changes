Changelog:
Created generateId() that deals with the id generation, checks if id is distinct. Deleted hash.
Created saveBoatClubToJsonFile() in RegistryHandler that deals with the JSON writing in a nicer way while removing exposure to the controller.
Changed method name from printBoatArray() to boatArrayToString() since this is what it does and it was a naming inconsistency.
    This made the corrector to thing that the model has UI responsibility.
    I have not found and other UI responsibilities in the model.
Changed all the functions in BoatClub to search by id instead of personalNumber and made them with functional programming
    this improved readability greatly and shortened the number of lines.
