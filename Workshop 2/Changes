    Created saveBoatClubToJsonFile() in RegistryHandler that deals with the JSON writing in a nicer way while removing exposure to the controller.
Fix: There is view responsibility in model classes.
    Removed the view responsibility form the model classes.
Fix: There are hidden dependencies between view and controller
    Removed hidden dependency between view and controller.
Fix: Business logic in the UI.

Additional fixes for life of quality:
Created addBoatToMember() since it was missing.
Changed method name from printBoatArray() to boatArrayToString() since this is what it does and it was a naming inconsistency.
Changed all the functions in BoatClub(big fix) to search by id instead of personalNumber and made them with functional programming,
this improved readability greatly and shortened the number of lines.
Moved Scanner to the view class.
Removed duplicated code and used new java 12 switch statement in controller.
