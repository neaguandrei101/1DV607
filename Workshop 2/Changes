Changelog:
Created generateId() that deals with the id generation, checks if id is distinct. Deleted hash.
Created saveBoatClubToJsonFile() in RegistryHandler that deals with the JSON writing in a nicer way while removing exposure to the controller.
Changed method name from printBoatArray() to boatArrayToString() since this is what it does and it was a naming inconsistency.
Changed all the functions in BoatClub to search by id instead of personalNumber and made them with functional programming,
    this improved readability greatly and shortened the number of lines.
Removed the view responsibility form the model classes.
Removed hidden dependency between view and controller.
Removed business logic in the controller, now createUser() is much better.
Created addBoatToMember() since it was missing.
